# The Sonnetator
Using the nltk package and all of Shakespeare's sonnets (from <a href="http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/">www.shakespeares-sonnets.com</a>), made a Shakespearian sonnet generator using trigrams. Using nltk's cmudist (a pronouncing dictionary) the sonnets follow the rhyming sheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.
